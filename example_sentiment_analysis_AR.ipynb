The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, three Special Reports2, and the Working \\nGroup I (WGI) contribution to the AR6 cycle.\\nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity3, and human societies (Figure\\xa0 SPM.1) and integrates \\nknowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments. The assessment of climate \\nchange impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall \\nunsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and \\neconomic inequalities and a pandemic.\\nThe scientific evidence for each key finding is found in the 18\\xa0chapters of the underlying report and in the 7\\xa0cross-chapter papers as well as the \\nintegrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS) and referred to in curly brackets {}. Based on scientific understanding, key \\nfindings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. The WGII \\nGlobal to Regional Atlas (Annex I) facilitates exploration of key synthesis findings across the WGII regions.\\nThe concept of risk is central to all three AR6 Working Groups. A risk framing and the concepts of adaptation, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, \\nequity and justice, and transformation provide alternative, overlapping, complementary, and widely used entry points to the literature assessed \\nin this WGII report.\\nAcross all three AR6 working groups, risk5 provides a framework for understanding the increasingly severe, interconnected and often irreversible \\nimpacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human systems; differing impacts across regions, sectors and communities; and \\nhow to best reduce adverse consequences for current and future generations. In the context of climate change, risk can arise from the dynamic \\ninteractions among climate-related hazards6 (see Working Group I), the exposure7 and vulnerability8 of affected human and ecological systems. \\nThe risk that can be introduced by human responses to climate change is a new aspect considered in the risk concept. This report identifies 127 \\nkey risks9. {1.3, 16.5}\\nThe vulnerability of exposed human and natural systems is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus in the literature. \\nApproaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved since previous IPCC assessments. Vulnerability is widely understood to differ \\nwithin communities and across societies, regions and countries, also changing through time.\\nAdaptation10 plays a key role in reducing exposure and vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation in ecological systems includes autonomous \\nadjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. In human systems, adaptation can be anticipatory or reactive, as well as incremental \\n1 Decision IPCC/XLVI-3, The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021.\\n2 The three Special Reports are: ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C. An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission \\npathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5)’; ‘Climate Change and Land. An IPCC \\nSpecial Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)’; ‘IPCC Special Report \\non the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)’.\\n3 Biodiversity: Biodiversity or biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the \\necological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.\\n4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, \\ne.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, \\nas likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Reports.\\n5 Risk is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.\\n6 Hazard is defined as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, \\ninfrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources. Physical climate conditions that may be associated with hazards are assessed in Working Group I as climatic \\nimpact-drivers.\\n7 Exposure is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and \\nsettings that could be adversely affected.\\n8 Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and \\nlack of capacity to cope and adapt.\\n9 Key risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems \\nexposed.\\n10 Adaptation is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities. In natural \\nsystems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this. 6SPM\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nHuman Society\\nLimits to adaptation\\nLosses and damagesClimate Change\\ncauses\\nImpacts and Risks\\nHuman Systems\\nTransitions\\nSocietal|E nergy\\nIndustry | Urban, Rural\\n& InfrastructureFuture Climate Change\\nLimiting Global Warming\\ns\\nral\\nEcosystems\\nTransitions\\nLand|Freshwater\\nCoastal |Ocean\\nEcosystems and\\ntheir biodiversityEcosystems\\nincluding biodiversity\\nLimits to adaptation\\nLosses and damages(a) Main interactions and trendsFrom climate risk to climate resilient development:  climate, ecosystems (including biodiversity) and human society as coupled systems\\nn\\ns\\ninclud\\nLim\\nRisks\\nVulnerabilityThe risk propeller shows that risk emerges from the overlap of:\\n...of human systems, ecosystems and their biodiversityExposur e Climate hazard(s)Governance\\nFinance\\nKnowledge and capacity\\nCatalysing conditions\\nTechnologies From urgent to \\ntimely actionprovision\\nLivelihoods,Ecosystem\\nServicesadaptto,mitigate impactsimpacts\\nEcosystembasedapproaches\\nconserve,restore\\nimpact\\nadaptsto,mitigatesGreenhousegasemissionsprovision\\nLivelihoods,Ecosystem\\nServicesadapts,maladapts,mitigatesimpactsimpacts\\nconserves,restores\\nimpactsadaptto,mitigate Climate Resilient\\nDevelopment\\nHuman health & well-being\\nequity, justice\\nEcosystem health\\nPlanetary health(b) Options to reduce climate risks and establish resilience\\nFigure\\xa0SPM.1 | This report has a strong focus on the interactions among the coupled systems climate, ecosystems (including their biodiversity) and human society. These interactions are the basis of emerging risks \\nfrom climate change, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, at the same time, offer opportunities for the future. \\n(a) Human society causes climate change. Climate change, through hazards, exposure and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages. Human society can adapt to, \\nmaladapt and mitigate climate change, ecosystems can adapt and mitigate within limits. Ecosystems and their biodiversity provision livelihoods and ecosystem services. Human society impacts ecosystems and can restore and conserve them. \\n(b) Meeting the objectives of climate resilient development thereby supporting human, ecosystem and planetary health, as well as human well-being, requires society and ecosystems to move over (transition) to a more resilient state. \\nThe recognition of climate risks can strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions and transitions that reduce risks. Taking action is enabled by governance, finance, knowledge and capacity building, technology and catalysing conditions. \\nTransformation entails system transitions strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and society (Section D). In a) arrow colours represent principle human society interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) \\nand the impacts of climate change and human activities, including losses and damages, under continued climate change (red). In b) arrow colours represent human system interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions \\n(green) and reduced impacts from climate change and human activities (grey). {1.2, Figure\\xa01.2, Figure\\xa0TS.\\xa02} 7SPM\\nSummary for Policymakersand/ or transformational. The latter changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its \\nimpacts. Adaptation is subject to hard and soft limits11.\\nResilience12 in the literature has a wide range of meanings. Adaptation is often organized around resilience as bouncing back and returning to \\na previous state after a disturbance. More broadly the term describes not just the ability to maintain essential function, identity and structure, \\nbut also the capacity for transformation.\\nThis report recognises the value of diverse forms of knowledge such as scientific, as well as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in \\nunderstanding and evaluating climate adaptation processes and actions to reduce risks from human-induced climate change. AR6 highlights \\nadaptation solutions which are effective, feasible13, and conform to principles of justice14. The term climate justice, while used in different ways in \\ndifferent contexts by different communities, generally includes three principles: distributive justice which refers to the allocation of burdens and \\nbenefits among individuals, nations and generations; procedural justice which refers to who decides and participates in decision-making; and \\nrecognition which entails basic respect and robust engagement with and fair consideration of diverse cultures and perspectives.\\nEffectiveness refers to the extent to which an action reduces vulnerability and climate-related risk, increases resilience, and avoids maladaptation15.\\nThis report has a particular focus on transformation16 and system transitions in energy; land, ocean, coastal and freshwater ecosystems; urban, \\nrural and infrastructure; and industry and society. These transitions make possible the adaptation required for high levels of human health and \\nwell-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health17, and planetary health18 (Figure\\xa0SPM.1). These system transitions are also important \\nfor achieving the low global warming levels (Working Group III) that would avoid many limits to adaptation11. The report also assesses economic \\nand non-economic losses and damages19. This report labels the process of implementing mitigation and adaptation together in support of \\nsustainable development for all as climate resilient development20.\\nBox\\xa0SPM.1 | AR6 Common Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods\\nAssessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature \\nincluding that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase \\n(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from \\nillustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)21 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)22 scenarios, respectively23. \\nClimate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though \\nsome recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding \\n11  Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions.  \\nHard adaptation limit—No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks.  \\nSoft adaptation limit—Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.\\n12 Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their \\nessential function, identity and structure as well as biodiversity in case of ecosystems while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is a positive attribute \\nwhen it maintains such a capacity for adaptation, learning, and/or transformation.\\n13 Feasibility refers to the potential for an adaptation option to be implemented.\\n14 Justice is concerned with setting out the moral or legal principles of fairness and equity in the way people are treated, often based on the ethics and values of society. Social justice comprises just or \\nfair relations within society that seek to address the distribution of wealth, access to resources, opportunity and support according to principles of justice and fairness. Climate justice comprises justice \\nthat links development and human rights to achieve a rights-based approach to addressing climate change.\\n15 Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate \\nchange, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence.\\n16 Transformation refers to a change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems.\\n17 Ecosystem health: a metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem, by analogy with human health. Note that there is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem. Rather, \\nthe apparent health status of an ecosystem is judged on the ecosystem’s resilience to change, with details depending upon which metrics (such as species richness and abundance) are employed in \\njudging it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment.\\n18 Planetary health: a concept based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of ecosystems.\\n19 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.\\n20 In the WGII report, climate resilient development refers to the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable development for all.\\n21 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n22 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of \\nradiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n23 IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed. 8SPM\\nSummary for Policymakerssocioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as \\nappropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are \\nmany emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range \\nof possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII \\nalso assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios \\nare analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs22. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including \\nimpacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 \\nSPM.C, WGI AR6 Box\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6\\xa012, AR5 WGI}\\nA common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference \\nperiod 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term \\n(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100). {CCB CLIMATE}\\nCommon levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication \\nof assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence.

The estimated \\nincrease in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C).25 \\nConsidering all five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach \\nor exceed 1.5°C in the near -term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario26. { WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, \\nWGI AR6 Table\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB 2.3}\\nB: Observed and Projected Impacts and Risks\\nSince AR5, the knowledge base on observed and projected impacts and risks generated by climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability has \\nincreased with impacts attributed to climate change and key risks identified across the report. Impacts and risks are expressed in terms of their \\ndamages, harms, economic, and non-economic losses. Risks from observed vulnerabilities and responses to climate change are highlighted. \\nRisks are projected for the near-term (2021–2040), the mid (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100), at different global warming levels and \\nfor pathways that overshoot 1.5°C global warming level for multiple decades27. Complex risks result from multiple climate hazards occurring \\nconcurrently, and from multiple risks interacting, compounding overall risk and resulting in risks transmitting through interconnected systems \\nand across regions.\\n24 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.\\n25 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements \\nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n26 Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report \\n(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded \\nunder the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary \\novershoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming.\\n27 Overshoot: In this report, pathways that first exceed a specified global warming level (usually 1.5°C, by more than 0.1°C), and then return to or below that level again before the end of a specified \\nperiod of time (e.g., before 2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot is also characterized. The overshoot duration can vary from at least one decade up to several decades.Box\\xa0SPM.1 (continued) 9SPM\\nSummary for PolicymakersObserved Impacts from Climate Change\\n28 Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assessment of confidence. {Annex II Glossary, CWGB ATTRIB}\\n29 Impacts of climate change are caused by slow onset and extreme events. Slow onset events are described among the climatic-impact drivers of the WGI AR6 and refer to the risks and impacts \\nassociated with e.g., increasing temperature means, desertification, decreasing precipitation, loss of biodiversity, land and forest degradation, glacial retreat and related impacts, ocean acidification, \\nsea level rise and salinization (https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch).\\n30 Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result of shocks risking determinants of food \\nsecurity and nutrition, and used to assess the need for humanitarian action.B.1 Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse \\nimpacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. Some development and \\nadaptation efforts have reduced vulnerability. Across sectors and regions the most vulnerable people and systems are ob-\\nserved to be disproportionately affected.

Multiple risks interact, generating new sources of vulnerability to climate hazards, and compounding overall \\nrisk (high confidence). Increasing concurrence of heat and drought events are causing crop production losses and tree mortality (high \\nconfidence). Above 1.5°C global warming increasing concurrent climate extremes will increase risk of simultaneous crop losses of maize \\nin major food-producing regions, with this risk increasing further with higher global warming levels (medium confidence). Future sea \\nlevel rise combined with storm surge and heavy rainfall will increase compound flood risks (high confidence). Risks to health and food \\nproduction will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by \\nheat-induced labour productivity losses (high confidence). These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, \\nand lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions \\n(high confidence). Risks to food safety from climate change will further compound the risks to health by increasing food contamination \\nof crops from mycotoxins and contamination of seafood from harmful algal blooms, mycotoxins, and chemical contaminants (high \\nconfidence). {Figure\\xa0TS.10c, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12, 7.2, 7.3, 9.8, 9.11, 10.4, 11.3, 11.5, 12.3, 13.5, 14.5, 15.3, Box\\xa015.1, 16.6, CCP1.2, \\nCCP6.2, , WGI AR6 SPM A.3.1, WGI AR6 SPM A.3.2, WGI AR6 SPM C.2.7}\\nB.5.2 Adverse impacts from climate hazards and resulting risks are cascading across sectors and regions (high confidence), propagating \\nimpacts along coasts and urban centres (medium confidence) and in mountain regions (high confidence). These hazards and cascading \\nrisks also trigger tipping points in sensitive ecosystems and in significantly and rapidly changing social-ecological systems impacted \\nby ice melt, permafrost thaw and changing hydrology in polar regions (high confidence).

In cities and (a) Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based \\non past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (Box\\xa0SPM.1). Changes relative to 1850–1900 based on 20-year averaging periods \\nare calculated by adding 0.85°C (the observed global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995–2014. Very likely ranges \\nare shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 (WGI AR6 Figure\\xa0SPM.8). Assessments were carried out at the global scale for (b), (c), (d) and (e). \\n(b) The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming \\nlow to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an \\nemphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk \\n(yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key \\nrisks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates \\nvery high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature \\nof the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future \\nprojected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and \\nhave high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme \\nweather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, \\nand coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, \\nexposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives \\naffected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused \\nby global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced \\nby a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. \\nRisks for (c) terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and (d) ocean ecosystems. For c) and d), diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. The transition to a very high \\nrisk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. \\n(e) Climate-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The assessed projections were based on a range of scenarios, including SRES, \\nCMIP5, and ISIMIP , and, in some cases, demographic trends. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP \\nscenarios in panel (a). \\n(f) Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness \\nof the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); \\nlikelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key \\nrisks is given in SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were limited by the \\navailability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries \\nwithin a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.

In high-carbon \\necosystems (currently storing 3,000 to 4,000 GtC)39 such impacts are already observed and are projected to increase with every \\nadditional increment of global warming, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and thawing of \\npermafrost, weakening natural land carbon sinks and increasing releases of greenhouse gases (medium confidence).

Many \\nadaptation options exist and are used to help manage projected climate change impacts, but their implementation depends upon the capacity and \\neffectiveness of governance and decision-making processes. These and other enabling conditions can also support climate resilient development \\n(Section D).\\nCurrent Adaptation and its Benefits\\n39 At the global scale, terrestrial ecosystems currently remove more carbon from the atmosphere (-3.4 ± 0.9 Gt yr-1) than they emit (+1.6 ± 0.7 Gt yr-1), a net sink of -1.9 ± 1.1 Gt yr-1. However, recent \\nclimate change has shifted some systems in some regions from being net carbon sinks to net carbon sources.\\n40 Adaptation gaps are defined as the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and \\nreflecting resource limitations and competing priorities.C.1 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple \\nbenefits\\xa0(very high confidence).\\xa0However, adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps40 (high \\nconfidence).\\xa0Many initiatives prioritize immediate and near-term climate risk reduction which reduces the opportunity for \\ntransformational adaptation (high confidence). {2.6, 5.14, 7.4, 10.4, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 16.3, 17.3, CCP5.2, CCP5.4}\\nC.1.1 Adaptation planning and implementation have continued to increase across all regions (very high confidence).
